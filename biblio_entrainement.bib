	abstract = {The turbulence generated by a vertically oscillating grid in a water tank and the entrainment across a salinity interface caused by this turbulence have been investigated experimentally. Measurements were carried out in a homogeneous layer of fluid as well as a two-layered fluid, which permitted us to determine the decay law of this turbulence and the way in which the structure of the turbulence depends on the mesh size and on the frequency and amplitude of the grid oscillation. It was found that the turbulent kinetic energy decays with distance from the grid according to a power law
              \${\textbackslash}overline\{q{\textasciicircum}2\}{\textbackslash}propto z{\textasciicircum}\{-n\}\$

The linear dependence of the r.m.s. turbulent velocity on the grid oscillation frequency found by Thompson \& Turner (1975) in the case of a square-bar grid has been confirmed. It is shown here that this linear relation remains valid when an interface is present and consequently the dependence of the entrainment velocity on the local Richardson number is of the form

              The deepening of a shear-driven turbulent layer penetrating into a stably stratified quiescent layer is studied using direct numerical simulation (DNS). The simulation design mimics the classical laboratory experiments by Kato \& Phillips (

              , vol. 37, 1969, pp. 643–655) in that it starts with linear stratification and applies a constant shear stress at the lower boundary, but avoids sidewall and rotation effects inherent in the original experiment. It is found that the layers universally deepen as a function of the square root of time, independent of the initial stratification and the Reynolds number of the simulations, provided that the Reynolds number is large enough. Consistent with this finding, the dimensionless entrainment velocity varies with the bulk Richardson number as

	abstract = {A theory is developed to describe the evolution of the entrainment interface in turbulent flow, in which the surface is convoluted by the large-scale eddies of the motion and at the same time advances relative to the fluid as a result of the micro-scale entrainment process. A pseudo-Lagrangian description of the process indicates that the interface is characterized by the appearance of ‘billows’ of negative curvature, over which surface area is, on average, being generated, separated by re-entrant wedges (lines of very large positive curvature) where surface area is consumed. An alternative Eulerian description allows calculation of the development of the interfacial configuration when the velocity field is prescribed. Several examples are considered in which the prescribed velocity field in the
              z
              direction is of the general form
              w
              = Wf(x – Ut), where the
              maximum
              value of the function
              f
              is unity. These indicate the importance of
              leading points
              on the surface which are such that small disturbances in the vicinity will move away from the point in all directions. The necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of one or more leading points on the surface is that
              U
              [les     ]
              V
              , the speed of advance of an element of the surface relative to the fluid element at the same point. The existence of leading points is accompanied by the appearance of line discontinuities in the surface slope re-entrant wedges, In these circumstances, the overall speed of advance of the convoluted surface is found to be
              W
              + (
              V
              2
              –
              U
              2
              )
              ½
              , where
              W
              is the maximum outwards velocity in the region; this result is independent of the distribution
              f.
            
            
              When the speed
              U
              with which an ‘eddy’ moves relative to the outside fluid is greater than the speed of advance
              V
              of an element of the front, the interface develops neither leading points nor discontinuities in slope; the amplitude of the surface convolutions and the overall entrainment speed are both reduced greatly. In a turbulent flow, therefore, the large-scale motions influencing entrainment are primarily those that move slowly relative to the outside fluid (with relative speed less than
              V
              ). The experimental results of Kovasznay, Kibens \& Blackwelder (1970) are reviewed in the light of these conclusions. It appears that in their experiments the entrainment speed
              V
              is of the order fifteen times the Kolmogorov velocity, the large constant of proportionality being apparently the result of augmentation by micro-convolutions of the interface associated with small and meso-scale eddies of the turbulence.},

This exchange, which regulates transient climate change and prevents large-scale hypoxia throughout the North Atlantic, is thought to be mediated by vertical mixing in the ocean's surface mixed layer. Here we present observational evidence that waters deeper than the conventionally defined mixed layer are affected directly by atmospheric forcing in this region. When northerly winds blow along the Irminger Sea's western boundary current, the Ekman response pushes denser water over lighter water, potentially triggering slantwise convection. We estimate that this down-front wind forcing is four times stronger than air–sea heat flux buoyancy forcing and can mix waters to several times the conventionally defined mixed layer depth. Slantwise convection is not included in most large-scale ocean models, which likely limits their ability to accurately represent subpolar water mass transformations and deep ocean ventilation.},

	abstract = {We use spin-up/spin-down laboratory experiments to study the neutrally stratified Ekman boundary layer. The experiments are performed in the 13 m diameter, 1 m deep Coriolis rotating tank of the LEGI in Grenoble, France. A global flow rotation is produced by an initial change in the tank rotation speed. It then slowly decays under the effect of Ekman friction, evolving from the turbulent state to the laminar state. It is checked that the Ekman layer itself remains in a quasi-steady state during this decay. The velocity is measured by Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) at two scales: the global rotation in a horizontal plane, and the vertical profile inside the boundary layer, where the three velocity components are obtained by stereoscopic PIV. The friction law is obtained by relating the decay rate of the bulk velocity to the velocity itself. This method is justified by the fact that this bulk velocity is independent of height beyond the top of the boundary layer (a few cm), as expected from the Taylor-Proudman theorem for rotating fluids. The local measurements inside the boundary layer provide profiles of the mean velocity and Reynolds stress components, in particular the cross-isobar angle between the interior and near surface velocities. In the laminar regime, good agreement is obtained with the classical Ekman's theory, which validates the method. In the turbulent regime, the results are found consistent with the classical Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) model based on the von Karman logarithmic layer. Our experiments therefore indicate that this theory, in principle valid for very large Reynolds numbers, is already relevant close to the transitional regimes. A fit of the empirical coefficients A and B appearing in this theory yields A = 3.3 and B = 3.0. Extrapolating the results to the atmospheric case gives a friction velocity u* about 12\% higher than the traditional fit for the ABL. We may safely deduce that for the oceanic bottom boundary layer, corresponding to lower Reynolds numbers than the atmosphere, our result provides a correct estimate within 10\%. The previous laboratory results of Caldwell et al. [“A laboratory study of the turbulent Ekman layer,” Geophys. Fluid Dyn. 3, 125–160 (1972)10.1080/03091927208236078] provided frictions velocities about 20\% higher than in our experiments, and slightly higher cross-isobar angles. We attribute this difference to the higher vortical Rossby number Rot in those experiments, and maybe also to roughness effects. We take into account the effect of this vortical Rossby number within the framework of the Ekman layer (Rot → 0) by replacing the tank rotation rate by the fluid rotation rate.},

	title = {Deepening of the wind-mixed layer: {A} model of the vertical structure},
	abstract = {A new non-linear model of mixing and convection based upon a modelling by two buoyant interacting fluids is applied to the deepening of the wind-mixed layer. In view of simple algebra, the model is one-dimensional, frictionless, and neglects the turbulence production by the mean-flow shear in the thermocline. The potential-energyincrease required for deepening is thus supplied by the turbulence input at the surface (turbulent erosion model). A non-similar analytical solution is found in the case of a well-mixed layer bounded below by a sharp thermocline, treated as a boundary layer. This solution is valid if the frictional Richardson number, Ri, defined as the ratio of the total mixed-layer buoyancy to the friction-velocity squared, is much greater than unity. The model predicts an entrainment rate proportional to Ri-’, and a ratio of thermocline thickness to mixed-layer depth of the order of Ri-3’4. The thermocline shallows as h-1’2,as the mixed-layer depth, h, increases with time. The vertical structure throughout the mixed layer and thermocline is given by the solution, and vertical profiles of mean values and vertical fluxes are plotted. These profiles are comparable to those obtained by turbulence-closurenumerical models.},
